## Getting Started

The Instrumentation Score Specification defines a standardized metric for assessing OpenTelemetry instrumentation quality. Before contributing, please:

1. **Read the specification**: Review the main [specification.md](./specification.md) document
2. **Understand the goals**: Familiarize yourself with the project's objectives and scope
3. **Join the community**: Connect with us on [CNCF Slack #instrumentation-score](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C090FEG5R0F)
4. **Review existing issues**: Check [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/instrumentation-score/spec/issues) for current discussions

## Ways to Contribute

We welcome various types of contributions:

### 📝 Documentation
- Improve specification clarity and completeness
- Fix typos, grammar, and formatting
- Add examples and use cases
- Enhance explanations of concepts

### 📋 Rules Development
- Propose new scoring rules
- Improve existing rule definitions
- Provide rationale for rule changes
- Contribute rule validation examples

### 🐛 Issue Reporting
- Report ambiguities or gaps in the specification
- Suggest improvements to existing rules
- Identify inconsistencies or contradictions

### 💡 Feature Proposals
- Suggest new features or capabilities
- Propose extensions to the scoring framework
- Share implementation experiences and feedback

### 🔬 Research and Analysis
- Provide research on instrumentation best practices
- Share data on real-world instrumentation patterns
- Contribute analysis of scoring effectiveness

## Contributing to the Specification

### Specification Structure

The main specification is organized into these key sections:
- **Introduction**: Project overview and goals
- **Prior Art**: Learning from existing scoring systems
- **Goals and Non-Goals**: Project scope definition
- **Detailed Specification**: Core technical specification
- **Score Calculation**: Mathematical framework
- **Rule Structure**: How rules are defined and applied

### Making Specification Changes

1. **Small Changes**: For minor fixes (typos, clarifications), submit a pull request directly
2. **Significant Changes**: For major modifications, start with an issue to discuss the proposal

### Specification Guidelines

- **Clarity**: Write clearly and avoid ambiguous language
- **Completeness**: Ensure all concepts are fully defined
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent terminology throughout
- **Implementability**: Ensure the specification can be practically implemented
- **Vendor Neutrality**: Avoid favoring specific tools or vendors

## Contributing Rules

Rules are the core mechanism for calculating instrumentation scores. They are located in the `rules/` directory.

After adding a rule or changing its description, run `python3 scripts/generate_rule_index.py` and include the updated `rules/README.md` in your pull request. The rule-index check in CI will catch an outdated index.

### Rule Structure

Each rule must include:
- **ID**: Unique identifier (e.g., RES-001, SPAN-042)
- **Description**: Clear, human-readable explanation
- **Rationale**: Why this rule matters for instrumentation quality
- **Criteria**: Specific, objective conditions for rule application
- **Target**: Which OTLP element it applies to (Resource, TraceSpan, Metric, Log)
- **Impact**: Impact level (Critical, Important, Normal, Low)

### Rule Guidelines

- **Objective**: Rules must be measurable and unambiguous
- **Based on Standards**: Align with OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions
- **Well-Justified**: Include clear rationale for the rule's importance
- **Implementable**: Ensure rules can be consistently implemented across tools
- **Tested**: Provide examples of when the rule should and shouldn't trigger

### Proposing New Rules

1. **Research**: Ensure the rule aligns with OpenTelemetry best practices
2. **Issue First**: Create an issue describing the proposed rule
3. **Community Input**: Allow time for community discussion
4. **Implementation**: Submit a pull request with the complete rule definition

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create your own fork of the project
2. **Create a Branch**: Use a descriptive branch name (e.g., `add-service-version-rule`)
3. **Make Changes**: Implement your changes with clear, focused commits
4. **Test**: Ensure your changes don't break existing content
5. **Submit PR**: Create a pull request with a clear description

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **Title**: Use a clear, descriptive title, following [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- **Description**: Explain what changes you made and why
- **Scope**: Keep PRs focused on a single issue or feature
- **Documentation**: Update related documentation as needed

### Commit Message Format

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:
```
feat: add rule for missing `service.version` attribute

- Defines RES-002 rule for service.version presence
- Categorized as "Important" impact
- Includes rationale and implementation criteria
```
