## Overview

The **Instrumentation Score** is a standardized, vendor-neutral metric that quantifies the quality of OpenTelemetry instrumentation. Represented as a numerical value from **0 to 100**, it provides objective feedback on how well a service or system follows OpenTelemetry best practices and semantic conventions.

The rules defined in this specification are classified into different impact levels, presenting actionable recommendations that teams can implement in order to improve the overall score of their services. These levels provide engineers with a recommended **prioritization** across a range of potential instrumentation issues, allowing them to focus on the most critical actions.

## Target Audience

While this specification can be used and implemented by anyone, we have identified key audiences who will benefit most from the Instrumentation Score:

### 🏢 Observability Platform Vendors

We expect vendors to adopt the Instrumentation Score as a standard metric in their platforms. This provides:
- **Consistent Quality Assessment**: Standardized scoring across different tools and platforms
- **Customer Value**: Clear instrumentation quality insights for users
- **Customer Advisory**: Use the spec as a framework when advising customers on instrumentation best practices

### 👩‍💻 Observability & Engineering Teams

Observability engineers and engineering teams are the primary users who will interpret and act on Instrumentation Scores:
- **Quality Assessment**: Understand instrumentation health at a glance
- **Improvement Guidance**: Get actionable insights for better instrumentation
- **Vendor Independence**: Carry knowledge between different observability platforms
- **Team Communication**: Use common vocabulary when discussing instrumentation quality

We encourage these teams to join the project and contribute their expertise:
- **Real-world Experience**: Share insights about what constitutes good vs. bad instrumentation
- **Rule Development**: Help define and refine scoring criteria
- **Use Case Validation**: Ensure rules reflect practical observability needs
- **Community Growth**: Expand the collective knowledge base

### Why Instrumentation Score?

As OpenTelemetry adoption grows, organizations face challenges with instrumentation quality:
- Missing critical attributes (e.g., `service.name`)
- Inefficient telemetry signal usage
- High cardinality issues
- Incomplete traces
- Inconsistent instrumentation patterns

The Instrumentation Score addresses these challenges by providing:

- **🎯 Common Vocabulary**: Shared language for discussing instrumentation quality
- **📊 Benchmarking**: Meaningful comparisons across services and over time
- **🔧 Actionable Guidance**: Clear feedback to improve instrumentation
- **💰 Efficiency**: Practices that lead to more cost-effective telemetry

## Quick Start

### Understanding Your Score

The Instrumentation Score uses these qualitative categories:

| Score Range | Category              | Meaning                                    |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 90-100      | **Excellent**         | High standard of instrumentation quality   |
| 75-89       | **Good**              | Solid quality; minor improvements possible |
| 50-74       | **Needs Improvement** | Tangible issues requiring attention        |
| 0-49        | **Poor**              | Significant problems needing urgent action |

### How It Works

1. **Analyze OTLP Data**: The score is calculated by analyzing OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) telemetry streams.
2. **Apply Rules**: A set of standardized rules evaluate traces, metrics, and resource attributes. Each rule is evaluated as a boolean condition with `true` implying success and `false` implying failure.
3. **Calculate Score**: Mathematical formula generates a single score, applying weights to each rule check.
4. **Provide Feedback**: Actionable insights guide improvements.

### Score Calculation

Let:

* $N$ be the total number of impact levels.
* $L_i$ denote the $i$-th impact level, where $i \in \{1, 2, \dots, N\}$.
* $W_i$ be the weight assigned to the $i$-th impact level ($L_i$).
* $P_i$ be the number of rules passed, or succeeded, for impact level $L_i$.
* $T_i$ be the total number of rules for impact level $L_i$.

The _Instrumentation Score_ is calculated as:

$$\text{Score} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (P_i \times W_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (T_i \times W_i)} \times 100$$

See the [Specification](./specification.md) for further examples and further details.

## Implementation

This specification is designed to be **implementation-agnostic**. Multiple tools can implement the Instrumentation Score calculation while maintaining consistency through the standardized rules.

### Implementation Requirements

- ✅ **MUST** implement all rules defined in this specification
- ✅ **MUST** use the standardized calculation formula
- ✅ **MUST** provide information if not all rules are implemented
- ✅ **MUST NOT** include additional rules that affect the standard score

## Rules Structure

Scoring rules are the foundation of the Instrumentation Score. Each rule includes:

- **ID**: Unique identifier (e.g., `RES-001`, `SPAN-042`).
- **Description**: Human-readable explanation.
- **Rationale**: Why this rule matters for quality.
- **Criteria**: Boolean condition that evaluates as `true` for success or `false` for failure.
- **Target**: OTLP element type (`Resource`, `TraceSpan`, `Metric`, `Log`),
- **Impact**: Impact level (`Critical`, `Important`, `Normal`, `Low`).

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in rule criteria are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

### Example Rule

```yaml
id: RES-001
description: "Service name must be present"
rationale: "service.name is fundamental for service identification and observability"
target: Resource
impact: Critical
type: Negative
criteria: "Resource attributes MUST contain 'service.name' key with non-empty value"
```
